    // Changing it does not trigger a re-render (unlike state variables, which trigger a re-render).
    // The information is local to each copy of your component (unlike the variables outside, which are shared).
    // Itâ€™s particularly common to use a ref to manipulate the DOM. React has built-in support for this.
